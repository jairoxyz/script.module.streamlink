# [Streamlink][streamlink-website]

Streamlink repacked for Kodi.



Streamlink is a CLI utility which pipes video streams from various services into a video player, such as VLC.

The main purpose of streamlink is to avoid resource-heavy and unoptimized websites, while still allowing the user to enjoy various streamed content.

Streamlink is a fork of the [Livestreamer][livestreamer] project.
